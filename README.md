# Personal Portfolio

This is my first attempt at creating my own personal website for two reasons:

1. To demonstrate my coding abilities.
2. To serve as a personal portfolio.
3. To continue to learn and develop my development skills.

### Planning

I decided to create this project using React, as I enjoy this technology and find it very powerful for building simple applications that may not need a database.

### Getting the ball rolling

To start I simply created a repository on GitHub, and then I used the following command to build the project on my local machine:
```
npx create-react-app personal-portfolio
cd personal-portfolio
npm start
```
At this point react is up and running.
